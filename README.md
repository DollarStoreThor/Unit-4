###    UNIT #4 : Machine Learning

###    Block 23 Workshop - Real Estate Distance Analysis

Data:  

    The dataset contains the following columns: 
    
    Property_ID: A unique identifier for each property 
    Latitude: Latitude of the property 
    Longitude: Longitude of the property 

Goals: 

    1. Loading the dataset using Numpy.
    
    2. Calculating distances using three distance metrics.
    
    3. Determining the closest 5 properties to a given.

###    Block 24 Workshop - Hyperparameter Tuning

Scenario:

    You are a data scientist working for a financial institution seeking to improve its credit risk assessment process. The institution processes a substantial volume of loan applications and wants to optimize its decision-making by adopting machine learning techniques. Your task is to fine-tune a classification model to enhance its ability to predict whether a loan applicant will likely default on their loan payments. 
    
Problem Statement:
    
    The financial institution you are employed at is keen on leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to make more accurate credit risk assessments. Given a dataset containing historical loan application data along with various applicant attributes, your objective is to optimize the performance of a Decision Tree Classifier through hyperparameter tuning. 

Goals: 

    1. Import the necessary libraries and generate a synthetic classification dataset using make_classification from sklearn.datasets. 
    
    2. Split the data into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function.
    
    3. Create a loop to train Decision Tree Classifiers.
    
    4. Plot the training and testing accuracies against the max_depth values using matplotlib.pyplot.
    
    5. Implement hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV from sklearn.model_selection.
    
    6. Fit the GridSearchCV on the training data and output the best hyperparameters using best_estimator_. 
    
    7. Output the accuracy of the best estimator on both the training and testing sets. 
    
    8. Matplotlib visualizing data
    
    9. Using accuracy_score from sklearn.metrics. 
    
    10. Determine Best hyperparameters
